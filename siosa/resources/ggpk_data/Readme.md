This directory contains metadata parsed from Path of exile's Content.ggpk files. Currently these files are generated by https://github.com/brather1ng/RePoE.,

For the actual GGPK parsing, PyPoE is used. RePoe just converts PyPoE's Python objects to JSON.


Steps to add more files here -
1. Ensure all files are on the same RePoe version generated for the same Poe League.
2. Add "repoe_version", and "poe_league" fileds to json data. "repoe_version" is the commit on which json files have been generated.
3. Add/Change corresponding resource reader classes.
